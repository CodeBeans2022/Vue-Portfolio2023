                    I am driven and self-motivated. I work hard to achieve my dreams and
                    goals. Furthermore, I am someone who would go above and beyond for
                    any company I work for and others in general. I believe in integrity
                    and loyalty. My greatest strengths are sympathy and empathy. I am a
                    caring and loving person that will always put my family and others
                    before myself.

                    My love and passion for technology started at a young age. Growing
                    up around my brother and cousins playing video games fascinated me.
                    My first time using technology was to play video games, and I loved
                    it! Still do. As the years went by, I became more interested in what
                    makes technology work. My passion grew even more when I studied I. T
                    and Computer Sciences. Ever since, it has been my dream to pursue
                    various fields in the tech industry.
